### Cleaning The Data: 


1. Loaded the Mustang Database from URL into linux by clicking website link. Use gunzip command in linux to unzip.  
  
  
2. Extractions:   

+ Extract completed jobs:grep COMPLETED mustang_release_v1.0beta.csv > CompletedMustang.csv. 

+ Extract Canceled jobs:grep CANCELLED mustang_release_v1.0beta.csv > CancelledMustang.csv

+ Extract Timed Out jobs: grep TIMEOUT mustang_release_v1.0beta.csv > TimeOutMustang.csv
  
  
3. Use Notepad++ to remove all empty lines and lines containing blank entries (can also be done in R or Linux): Line editor, delete blank rows and find ',,', then bookmark, then delete bookmarks.Save as:  

+ CompletedMustangScrub.csv

+ CancelledMustangScrub.csv

+ TimeOutMustangScrub.csv
  
  
4. since the original file is too large to fit into notepad ++, concatinate the 3 files together  

+ cat CompletedMustangScrub.csv CancelledMustangScrub.csv TimeOutMustangScrub.csv
  
  
5. Take columns 3,4,5 (the submit times, the start times, and the end times respectively) in linux using the command   

+ cut -d , -f 3,4,5,8 CompletedMustangScrub.csv > CompletedMustangTimes.csv 
+ cut -d , -f 3,4,5,8 CancelledMustangScrub.csv > CancelledMustangTimes.csv 
+ cut -d , -f 3,4,5,8 TimeOutMustangScrub.csv > TimeOutMustangTimes.csv 
  
  
6. The -6:00 and -7:00 extenstions indicate timezone, convert all the data so that it is in the same timezone. -06:00 is EST and -07:00 is EDT

7. Load these datasets into the R workspace.


### Extracting the Service times and Interarrival Times: 

The service times were divided by the total number of "cores" used (number of nodes times 24). Some jobs required zero nodes, I have contacted the database managers to inquire about this, for now, I will assume that these jobs require a single set of cores, 24. Interarrival time was not altered. Both are Converted to a numeric. Note, all the elapsed times are recorded in seconds. 


```{r}
CompTimes = read.csv('CompletedMustangTimes.csv')

##Load csv, convert into timestamp data frame.
CompTimes = read.csv('CompletedMustangTimes.csv')

#Sort the times in chronological order of arrival.
CompTimes = CompTimes[order(as.POSIXct(CompTimes[,1])),,drop=FALSE]


#Extract arrival and start and end of service.
CompEnd = as.POSIXct(CompTimes[,3], tz = "Etc/GMT+5")
CompStart = as.POSIXct(CompTimes[,2], tz = "Etc/GMT+5")
CompSubmit = as.POSIXct(CompTimes[,1], tz = "Etc/GMT+5")


#Calculate Service Times
CompServiceTime = as.numeric(CompEnd-CompStart)

#Make the 0 nodes 1, divide by 24*number of nodes
CompCores = CompTimes[,4] 
CompCores[CompCores == 0] = 1
AdjCompService = CompServiceTime / (24*CompCores)

#Calculate interarrival Times
CompInterArrival = as.numeric(diff(CompSubmit))

#Calculate Arrival Times 
ComparrivalTimes = c(0, cumsum(CompInterArrival))

#Clear out nonpositive service times 
ComparrivalTimes = ComparrivalTimes[- which(CompServiceTime <= 0)]
AdjCompService = AdjCompService[- which(CompServiceTime <= 0)]
```

```
### The Curious Case of Shifted Departure Process: 

Although it appears that the exponential departure process is just a "shifted up" version of the trace departure process. This is not the case as shown below. This vector shows the difference between the two for every 5th lag value. My hypothesis is: this similarity in the shape of the curve may be caused by the fact that both departures are influenced by the same arrival times, and service times of the same mean. It seems that this indicates that arrival times have a much greater influence on the interdeparture autocorrelation than the service times.

```{r}
#every 5th difference be
(ACFE$acf[-1]- ACFT$acf[-1])[seq(from = 1, to = 61, by =5)]
```

### Smoothness of Autocorrelation Curves 

Since the interarrival times have a much larger standard deviation that the service times, the autocorrelation curve of the arrival process is much more 'jagged'. For completely random data, like that of the exponential service time, the autocorrelation plot just looks like noise. By observing the formula for autocorrelation below, it is clear that a larger standard deviation will cause the numerator of the equation to be more sensitive to changes in lag, as the accumulation of $y-\bar{y}$ will be larger for more varied data. This might explain why the that arrival times have a much greater influence on the interdeparture autocorrelation than the service times, leading to the seemingly "shifted" departure process above.

$$
r_k = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N-k}(Y_i - \bar{Y})(Y_{i+k} - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}
$$

### Comparison:  
  The trace driven and exponentially driven data yielded the same system utilization. This is expected, as system utilization is entirely dependent on: mean service time, the number of jobs, and the total time of simulation-- all of these are the same for both simulations. I was very surprised that both resulted in such a small system utilization. This may be caused by the "division by total number of cores", as this decreased the mean service time but not the total time of simulation, and the long duration that the simulation takes place. I thought at first, that this also might be caused by the large gaps in machine idle time. After analysis of the Interarrival times, the largest gap where no job arrives only takes up about 0.32% of the total time of simulation, and it is possible (and probable) that the server is processing jobs during this time.
  The average waiting queue length and job delay time for the trace driven simulation was much smaller than that of the exponentially driven simulation. This was strange to me, as a larger coefficient of variation should indicate longer queues and job delay time.
  The autocorrelation of the departure process as a function of Lag of the departure times looks very similar for the trace driven and exponentially driven simulation, except the exponential is a little bit more self correlated. This similarity in the departure process autocorrelation shape is most likely caused by the shared arrival time data and mean service time. 
  Another curious aspect of this data is the fact that the autocorrelation stays relatively constant as lag increases, I would expect a steeper decline in autocorrelation.
  
  
### The Effect of system Utilization on Average Queue Length and Wait Time: Original Trace 

In order to find interarrival times that gave the desired System utilization, I used a simple guess and test method. Also, I used that fact that when the mean interarrival time increases, system utilization will decrease. I kept the interarrival times constant throughout the simulation for more control.

### Comparison of trace driven and exponential Delay and Trace by system utilization. 

The queue length and delay follow the same pattern: an exponential increase for the trace data and a seemingly exponential increase and leveling off for the Exponential data.

### Analysis of the Effects of arrival times with increasing System Utilization on mean queue length, job delay, and autocorrelation of departure process.

  
  The autocorrelation of the trace and exponential departure data behaved as expected; larger system utilization yielded a much stronger autocorrelation. For the exponential data, the autocorrelation is lesser overall and much closer for different values of utilization.
